                            <p>Habits and Contradictions helped ScHoolboy Q rise even more in his rap career along with his labelmates at Top Dawg, like most notably Kendrick Lamar. This album had Single "Hands on the Wheel ft. A$AP Rocky and though not a single, I find the song "Blessed ft. Kendrick Lamar" to be very good.</p>
